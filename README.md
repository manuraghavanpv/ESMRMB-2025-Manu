# Threshold PCA Denoising Outperforms MP-PCA in Correlation Tensor Imaging of Human Brain Microstructure at 3T
Correlation Tensor Imaging (CTI) is an advanced diffusion MRI method based on Double-Diffusion-Encoding (DDE) that separates diffusional kurtosis into isotropic (Kiso), anisotropic (Kaniso), and microscopic (μK) components, offering greater specificity for brain microstructure characterization. While CTI has shown strong potential in preclinical studies, and was recently demonstrated in humans, current protocols require long acquisitions (~50 min), limiting clinical feasibility. Accelerating CTI will drastically reduce acquisition time but also exacerbate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) losses, making effective denoising crucial. PCA-based methods such as Marčenko-Pastur PCA (MP-PCA) and Threshold PCA (TPCA) have shown promise for denoising diffusion MRI data without compromising microstructural information. While MP-PCA denoising classifies principal components based on the Marčenko Pastur distribution, assuming spatially uncorrelated noise, TPCA incorporates a prior estimate of the noise variance to establish a threshold for noise component removal, enhancing robustness in scenarios with spatially correlated noise. This study evaluates, for the first time, the effects of MP-PCA and TPCA denoising on CTI-derived metrics in healthy human brains.
